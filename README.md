# duckdns
Instead of using cronjobs and/or any other loop script, let us use Systemd
timers to update our domains at DuckDNS. The default Systemd timers are set on
every 5 minutes, you can change this yourself.

## Installation

### Arch/AUR
Info coming soon, probably will be packaged under the name

Clone/download this repo on your computer

	mv duckdns.sh /usr/bin/duckdns
	chmod +x /usr/bin/duckdns
	mv duckdns.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
	mv duckdns.timer /usr/lib/systemd/system/

	mkdir -p /etc/duckdns.d
	mv default.cfg /etc/duckdns.d/

	systemctl enable duckdns.timer
	systemctl start duckdns.timer


### Configuration

The **default.cfg** file shows perfectly what options you must enter, you can
create new files if you have multiple domains with the same setup.

	duckdns_hostname=
	duckdns_token=

Nothing more is needed.

Config files must be placed inside the `/etc/duckdns.d/` folder.
